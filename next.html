        <h1>Hi, my love!</h1>
        <h2>Happy Valentine's Day!</h2>
        <p>To my love, my sun, my best friend, and my whole world, 
            I love you so so much. 
            Every moment with you is truly a blessing, and every day I feel so grateful to have such a hard working, patient,
            kind, smart, loving, and overall amazing person in my life.
            Thank you for being the best boyfriend I could have ever asked for and more.
        Long distance has been more difficult than we anticipated, but you make things so much easier with your constant love and support.
        Honestly, life in general has been such a rollercoaster, but I'm very happy to be riding it with you.

        I wasn't sure what I initially wanted to do with this little website, but
        I thought it'd be nice to create a little gallery for us to look back to and see how much we've grown together. Let's go!</p>
